In powershell everything is an object.
In technical terms, an object is an individual instance of specific template, called a class.
A class specifies the kinds of things an object will contain. An objects class determines its methos, or actions that can be taken on that object.
In other words, the methods are all the things an object can do.
For example a list object might ahve sort() method that when called will sort the list. Likewise an objects class determines its properties, the objects variables.

$color = 'red'
$color.Length
    3

Get-Member -InputObject $color
this will list all methods and properties that exist on this string object.

So lets use a method:
$color.Remove(1,1)
 Rd
now when you call color you get it lower case:
$color
    red
