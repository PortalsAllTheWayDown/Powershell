Arrays and ArrayLists are great when you need your data associated with only a position in a list.
If you have a list of usernames you want to match to real names you could use a hashtable(or dictionary).
A hashtable is a PowerShell data structure that contains a list of key-value pairs.

$users = @{
    abertram = 'Adam Bertram';
    raquelcer = 'Raquel Cerillo';
    zheng21 = 'Justin Zheng'
}

$users

Name        value
----        -----
abertram    Adam Bertram
raquelcer   Raquel Cerillo
zheng21     Justin Zheng

Powershell will not let you define a hashtable with duplicate keys. Each key has to uniquely point to a single value,  which can be an array or even another hashtable!


Reading Elements from Hashtables:
To access a specific value in a hash table you use its key.
There are two ways:
$users['abertram']
Adam Bertram

$users.abertram
Adam Bertram

To access the Keys and Values properties:

$users.Keys
abertram
raquelcer
zheng21

$users.Values
Adam Bertram
Raquel Cerillo
Justin Zheng

To see all properties of a hastable run:
Select-Object -InputObject $yourobject -Property *

Adding and Modifying Hashtable Items

$users.Add('natice', 'Natalie Ice')
$users['phrigo'] = 'Phil Rigo'
