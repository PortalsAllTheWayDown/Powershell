All variables in powershell start with a dollar sign $
to display a variable put : $MaximumHistoryCount

change it: $MaximumHistoryCount = 200

$color = 'blue'

automatic variables:
There are premade variables that powershell itself uses.
$null equals nothing and is intended this way.
$LASTEXITCODE gives you the last exit code of your last powershell command
for example if you ping an incorrect domain name the exit code is 1
if you ping google.com the exit code is 0 which means it didnt error out.

This is how you can find all variables ending in preference

Get-Variable -Name *Preference

$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
-Changing this variable to silently continue will make it to where when you should get an error it doesnt put anything out.
-This is what your would call a preference variable
