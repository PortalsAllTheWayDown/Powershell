Bools,Strings, and Integers

$foo = 1
$foo = 'one'
$foo = $true

$num = 1
$num.GetType().name
    Int32
$num = 1.5
$num.GetType().name
    Double
[Int32]$num
    2

$language = 'PowerShell'
$color = 'blue'
$sentence = "Today, you learned that $language loves the color $color"
$sentence
    Today, you learned that PowerShell loves the color blue

If you do the sentence with '' single quotes it wont work. it will come out:
    Today, you learned that $language loves the color $color

Powershell wont look past the single quotes so whatever you put in single quotes comes out a literal.
